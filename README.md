# Recommender-system

This project is a good exercise for recommender system using collaborative recommendation. At the end of the script, I also include the SVD using default numpy package as we don't have NaN in our user-item matrix.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I'm interestested in building a recommendation algorithm. From Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree courses I learned that there are three types of recommender system: knowledget based; collaborative and content based. This script is built for collaborative recommendation system, which rely heavily on user-user similarity and user-item relationship. 

I will open another repo specifically for FUNK SVD method.

## Structure <a name="structure"></a>

The project contains several parts and the key is the User-User Based Collaborative Filtering section.

###1 Exploratory Data Analysis
###2 Rank Based Recommendations
###3 User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
###4 Matrix Factorization
###5 Extras & Concluding

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Figure Eight for the data. Also thanks for Udacity to provide the framework for me to finish the project.
